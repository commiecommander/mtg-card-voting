      <h2>Power Levels for Commander</h2>
      <div class="bracket-grid">
        <div class="bracket">
          <h3>Power Level 1: Exhibition</h3>
          <p><strong>Ultra-Casual:</strong> These are cards you’ll see in almost any game. They’re often thematic, fun, and not focused on winning. Think of them as the foundation of casual, exhibition-style games where the goal is to enjoy the experience rather than dominate.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bracket">
          <h3>Power Level 2: Core</h3>
          <p><strong>Precon-Level:</strong> These cards are the backbone of most preconstructed decks. They’re solid, reliable, and form the foundation of many decks. While they’re not game-winners on their own, they’re essential for building a functional deck. Examples include cards like <em>Sol Ring</em> or <em>Cultivate</em>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bracket">
          <h3>Power Level 3: Upgraded</h3>
          <p><strong>Optimized Play:</strong> These are cards that take a deck to the next level. They’re often better versions of cards found in precons and are included with a specific game plan in mind. They’re powerful but not overwhelming, and they allow decks to run more smoothly without completely dominating the game.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bracket">
          <h3>Power Level 4: Optimized</h3>
          <p><strong>High-Power Play:</strong> These cards are highly impactful and can swing games in a major way. They often demand immediate answers and can win games outright if left unchecked. They’re the kind of cards you’d expect to see in high-powered games, where players are looking for strong, synergistic strategies.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bracket">
          <h3>Power Level 5: cEDH</h3>
          <p><strong>Competitive Play:</strong> These cards are the backbone of competitive Commander (cEDH) decks. They’re designed to win games as efficiently as possible, often through combos, fast mana, or overwhelming card advantage. While they’re still part of Commander, they’re focused on the metagame and tournament play.</p>
