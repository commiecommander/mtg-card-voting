          <h3>Bracket 1</h3>
          <p><strong>Casual Commander:</strong> Relaxed game pieces focused on fun interactions with basic investment of game mechanics. Perfect for low-power, social games.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bracket">
          <h3>Bracket 2</h3>
          <p><strong>Average Commander:</strong> Cards that may resemble Bracket 1 with additional upsides or Bracket 3 and 4 with drawbacks or requirements. Balanced for mid-power games.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bracket">
          <h3>Bracket 3</h3>
          <p><strong>High-Power Commander:</strong> Conditionally powerful cards that can deliver strong outcomes but are still reasonably answerable by a table. Ideal for optimized decks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bracket">
          <h3>Bracket 4</h3>
          <p><strong>Competitive Commander:</strong> High-power cards that make decks far more consistent. These cards are often high-salt and suggested for competitive play. Not to be confused with cEDH, which is an entirely different level of power.</p>
