        <div class="bracket">
          <h3>Bracket 1</h3>
          <p><strong>Casual Commander:</strong> Relaxed game pieces focused on fun interactions with basic investment of game mechanics. Perfect for low-power, social games.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bracket">
          <h3>Bracket 2</h3>
          <p><strong>Average Commander:</strong> Cards that may resemble Bracket 1 with additional upsides or Bracket 3 and 4 with drawbacks or requirements. Balanced for mid-power games.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bracket">
          <h3>Bracket 3</h3>
          <p><strong>High-Power Commander:</strong> Conditionally powerful cards that can deliver strong outcomes but are still reasonably answerable by a table. Ideal for optimized decks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bracket">
          <h3>Bracket 4</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>High-Power Optimization:</strong> These cards are highly optimized for powerful strategies and can significantly increase a deck's consistency and power level. While they are not designed for competitive play, they can sometimes serve as a gateway to competitive Commander (cEDH). Use these cards with caution, as they may lead to high-salt games.
