        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            The Commander Collective was born out of the fallout from the September 2024 bannings and the growing influence of Wizards of the Coast (WotC) over the Commander format. We believe in <strong>player power</strong> and the importance of a community-driven approach to the game we all love.
        </p>

        <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
        <p>
            The current system, where card evaluations and game-changing decisions are solely in the hands of WotC and the Commander Format Panel (CFP), leaves little room for the voices of the players. We disagree with this top-down approach and believe that the community should have a say in how our format evolves.
        </p>

        <h2>What We Stand For</h2>
        <p>
            Every content creator and player has their own experiences and perspectives on what makes a card powerful or format-warping. While it may seem impossible to create a unified rating system, we believe that <strong>together, as a community, we can</strong>. Tools like EDHRec and other deck-building resources already give us the data we needâ€”now it's time to put that power in the hands of the players.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            This site is a tool for the community to come together and share their insights. Whether it's voting on card power levels, discussing game-changers, or analyzing decks, we aim to create an <strong>unofficial check and balance</strong> to the decisions made by the Commander Format Panel. This is your platform to make your voice heard.
        </p>

        <h2>Join Us</h2>
