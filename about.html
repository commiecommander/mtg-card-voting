        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            The Commander Collective was born out of the fallout from the September 2024 bannings and the growing corporate control of Wizards of the Coast (WotC) over the Commander format. We believe in <strong>collective power</strong> and the importance of a decentralized, community-driven approach to the game we all love.
        </p>

        <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
        <p>
            The current system, where card evaluations and game-changing decisions are dictated by corporate interests and a small, unelected panel, leaves little room for the voices of the players. We reject this top-down, authoritarian approach and believe that the community—the true heart of Commander—should have the power to shape the format.
        </p>

        <h2>What We Stand For</h2>
        <p>
            Every content creator and player has their own experiences and perspectives on what makes a card powerful or format-warping. While it may seem impossible to create a unified rating system under a corporate-controlled framework, we believe that <strong>together, as a collective, we can</strong>. Tools like EDHRec and other deck-building resources already give us the data we need—now it's time to reclaim that power for the players.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            This site is a tool for the community to come together and share their insights. Whether it's voting on card power levels, discussing game-changers, or analyzing decks, we aim to create an <strong>unofficial, grassroots check and balance</strong> to the decisions made by the Commander Format Panel. This is your platform to resist corporate overreach and build a format that truly serves the players.
        </p>

        <h2>Join Us</h2>
        <p>
            If you believe in a future for Commander that is <strong>decentralized, democratic, and by the players, for the players</strong>, register to vote, share your experiences, and help us build a more inclusive and player-focused format. Together, we can ensure that Commander remains a format that values community over profit and collective power over corporate control.
